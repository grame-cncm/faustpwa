# Faust Progressive Web Applications

 A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app">Progressive Web Application (PWA)</a> is a
type of web application that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. To install a PWA, flash the QR Code (or click on the picture), then click the "Install" or "Add to Home Screen" prompt, and follow the instructions. The PWA will then appear on your device's home screen like a native app.
PWAs are cross-platform and work on most devices with modern web browsers.
