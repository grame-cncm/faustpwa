# Faust Progressive Web Applications

 A [Progressive Web Application (PWA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app) is a
type of web application that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. Faust DSP programs can be compiled and [exported as PAW](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/manual/deploying/#exporting-for-the-web).

## Installation
To install a PWA, flash the QR Code (or click on the picture), then click the *Install* or *Add to Home Screen* prompt, and follow the instructions. The PWA will then appear on your device's home screen like a native app. PWAs are cross-platform and work on most devices with modern web browsers like Chrome.
